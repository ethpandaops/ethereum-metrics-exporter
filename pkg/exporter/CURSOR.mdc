# Exporter Component

Main orchestrator that coordinates collection and export of Ethereum metrics from execution, consensus, and disk monitoring components.

## Key Patterns
- **Plugin Architecture**: Uses modular exporters (execution, disk, consensus) with independent lifecycle management
- **Configurable Modules**: Execution client supports selective RPC module activation (eth, net, web3, admin, txpool)
- **Async Collection**: Each exporter runs metrics collection in separate goroutines with context-based cancellation
- **Interface-Based**: Core `Exporter` interface enables clean separation between orchestration and implementation

## Architecture Constraints
- All exporters must support graceful shutdown via context cancellation
- Prometheus metrics server runs independently from collection goroutines
- Configuration validation occurs at initialization, not runtime
- Each sub-component (execution, disk, consensus) manages its own connection lifecycle
