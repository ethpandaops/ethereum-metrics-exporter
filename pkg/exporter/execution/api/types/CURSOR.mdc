# Types Component

Go type definitions for Ethereum execution layer API responses that handle client-specific response format variations.

## Key Patterns
- **Flexible JSON Unmarshaling**: Custom UnmarshalJSON methods handle different client response formats (string vs numeric difficulty values)
- **Common Types**: Provides shared type definitions for admin_nodeInfo and txpool_status RPC method responses
- **Client Compatibility**: Ensures consistent type handling across different Ethereum execution clients (Geth, Besu, Nethermind, etc.)

## Architecture Constraints
- All types must support both string (0x-prefixed) and numeric difficulty value formats
- Type definitions should match exactly with corresponding RPC method response schemas
- Custom JSON unmarshaling logic must gracefully fallback between format attempts
