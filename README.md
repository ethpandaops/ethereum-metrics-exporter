# ðŸ¦„ Ethereum Metrics Exporter ðŸ¦„

> A Prometheus metrics exporter for Ethereum execution & consensus nodes

Ethereum client implementations expose extensive Prometheus metrics however there is minimal standardization around the metrics structure. This makes observability across multiple clients a painful experience. This exporter hopes to help alleviate this problem by creating a client-agnostic set of metrics that operators can run without any additional configuration to dashboards or alerting.

To provide these client-agnostic metrics the exporter relies entirely on these well-defined APIs:
- Execution clients
  - [JSON-RPC](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server)
- Consensus clients
  - [Beacon Node API](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/)

Naturally this means that the exporter is limited to metrics that are exposed by these APIs.

## Built With

* [ethereum/go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)

### Standalone
**Downloading a release**
Available [here](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-metrics-exporter/releases)

**Building yourself (requires Go)**

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-metrics-exporter.git
   ```
2. Change directories
   ```sh
   cd ./ethereum-metrics-exporter
   ```
3. Build the binary
   ```sh
   make build
   ```
4. Run the exporter
   ```sh
   ./build/ethereum-metrics-exporter
   ```

## Development

This project includes a Makefile to simplify common development tasks. Here are the available commands:

### Running the full stack

Note: To run the full stack, you need to have [kurtosis installed](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install).

```sh
# This starts up a kurtosis devnet with a beacon node and an execution nodes
# It will then also start the exporter and expose the metrics of the first beacon and execution node on port 9090
make devnet-run
```

### Building

```sh
# Build for current platform
make build

# Build for Linux amd64
make build-linux

# Build for all platforms (using goreleaser)
make build-all

# Install to $GOPATH/bin
make install
```

### Testing & Quality

```sh
# Run tests with race detection and coverage
make test

# Run short tests only
make test-short

# Generate coverage report
make coverage

# Run linting
make lint

# Run linting with auto-fix
make lint-fix

# Run go vet
make vet

# Format code
make fmt
```

### Dependencies

```sh
# Download dependencies
make deps

# Tidy dependencies
make tidy

# Verify dependencies
make verify
```

### Releases

```sh
# Create a release (requires proper git tags and GitHub token)
make release

# Create a snapshot release for testing
make release-snapshot
```

### Docker

```sh
# Build Docker image
make docker-build

# Push Docker image
make docker-push
```

### Other Commands

```sh
# Run the application directly
make run

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Check if required tools are installed
